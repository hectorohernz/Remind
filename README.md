# Remind - Grocery List Helper

Ok let's be honest, everyone hates shopping at a grocery store, but when we do go grocery shopping we tend to forget why we are there in the first place. So that's why I created this small web application. The sole purpose is to help you feel like you have conquered the lords of your local Walmart, and walk out those doors with your full list of groceries without double questioning whether you had ice cream sandwiches on the list. Enjoy!
